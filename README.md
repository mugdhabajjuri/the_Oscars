Data Visualizations
==============================

Story telling and visualization to describe the data set.

I have visualized the Olympic data using Jupyter notebooks and Tableau.

Datasets considered here are **"Olympics data"** 

Path to Olympic data --> /data/raw/athlete_events.csv and /data/raw/noc_regions.csv
  
This is the Visualizations for the Olympics data for which EDA was done [here] (https://github.com/mugdhabajjuri/Datascience1)
