Data Visualizations
==============================

Story telling and visualization to describe the 120 years of Olympics data, dating from 1896 to 2016.

For the analysis, **"Jupyter notebooks"** and **"Tableau**" are used.
  
Data sets are collected from previous project "Jimmy Wrangler - Data Exploration"

# Story telling in Jupyter Notebook


## Distribution of the age of gold medalists



![png](reports/first.png)


### There are people who have won gold medals with Age greater than 50 üò≤üò≤üò≤

#### let's see how many people won gold medals after turning 50 üèÖ


```python
goldMedals['ID'][goldMedals['Age'] > 50].count()
```




    65



### üïïüïî people!!!  That's great

### Let's dive deep into age of the olympic participants


![png](reports/second.png)


### Two things to observe here :
#### - There are participants, whose age is over 80 üëè
#### - In 1904 female age distribution is strongly different from the other Olympics



### ART COMPETITIONS --- I did not know that the Olympics include Art Competitions!!

### Female age distribution in 1904











### Height vs Weight of Olympic Medalists




![png](reports/third.png)


From above graph it can be seen that the more the weight, the more the height i.e., linear relation

### Let's athelets whose weight is more than 160 kilograms


```python
notNullMedals.loc[notNullMedals['Weight'] > 160]
```
